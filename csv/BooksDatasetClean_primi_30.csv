Germs : Biological Weapons and America's Secret War,"By Miller, Judith, Engelberg, Stephen, and Broad, William J.","Deadly germs sprayed in shopping malls, bomb-lets spewing anthrax spores over battlefields, tiny vials of plague scattered in Times Square -- these are the poor man's hydrogen bombs, hideous weapons of mass destruction that can be made in a simple laboratory. In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century."," Technology & Engineering , Military Science",Simon & Schuster,4.99,October,2001

All over but the Shoutin',"By Bragg, Rick","A New York Times Notable Book of the YearThis haunting, harrowing, gloriously moving recollection of a life on the American margin is the story of Rick Bragg, who grew up dirt-poor in northeastern Alabama, seemingly destined for either the cotton mills or the penitentiary, and instead became a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone. Evoking these lives--and the country that shaped and nourished them--with artistry, honesty, and compassion, Rick Bragg brings home the love and suffering that lie at the heart of every family. The result is unforgettable."," Biography & Autobiography , Personal Memoirs",Vintage,4.89,September,1998

Hill Rat: Blowing the Lid Off Congress,"By Jackley, John L.","As a top aide to powerful Texas Congressman Ronald Coleman, John Jackley watched the nation's highest elected officials lie, manipulate media images, and spend millions of taxpayer dollars to stay in power. The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. ""Today,"" he writes, ""a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!""His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others. Jackley also reveals, with names, dates, and examples, the outrageous power of Congressional staffers--""Hill Rats""--who ""run the engines of democracy on a daily basis and pride themselves on their ability to do anything in the name of their cause.""To show the flagrant abuse of taxpayers' money for re-election purposes, Jackley points out that in just forty-eight hours in early 1992, the House mailed more than 58 million newsletters and postcards. In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected. Even in 1988, only six Members running for re-election were defeated, a turnover rate less than that of the Soviet Politburo.From previously untold Congressional involvement in Oliver North's contra re-supply network to Democratic complicity in the S&L crisis to the taxpayer-funded incumbent protection plan, Hill Rat reveals secrets backed by hard evidence that will shake the House and shock the nation."," Political Science , General","Regnery Publishing, Inc.",4.99,April,1992

Shadow Song,"By Kay, Terry","It was a wonderful summer, a great memory, the kind of love everybody ought to have. It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee ""Bobo"" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself...."," Fiction , General",Atria Books,4.99,October,1994
